**Project: Laptop Option for COBOL Programming Course**

**Project Description:**
Based on the highly successful OMP COBOL Course, an new fork has been created to extend accessibility using a Cloud based environment. This project will further extend that self-contained environment packaging it in a virtual machine such that it can be run on a laptop without an internet connection.

**Problem Definition:**
Throughout the world there are students who want to learn mainframe skills, but for whom an internet connection is not available or consistent.  An offline version of the course that could be downloaded from a public or university internet connection can help to produce more equitable outcomes for this population.

**Deliverables**
CICS Programming Basics course material and labs
VM based version of the training environment to be run 'stand alone' on a laptop
